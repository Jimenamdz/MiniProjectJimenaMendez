Mini Project: Data Analysis by Jimena MÃ©ndez

This project demonstrates my skills in data analysis and visualization through two distinct datasets:

Iris Dataset:
Explored the relationships between sepal and petal measurements.
Performed statistical analyses, including covariance and correlation matrices.
Developed clear visualizations to support the findings.

Laptop Dataset:
Conducted data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis.
Investigated pricing trends, operating systems, and hardware specifications.
Implemented insightful visualizations to summarize key observations.
The primary file for this project is Mini_Project_Jimena_Mendez.py, which contains the complete implementation for both datasets. This file highlights my approach to extracting meaningful insights through structured analysis and thoughtful visualizations.
